Lab 8: Routing in React
================

Currently, we have one screen and one path that our users can visit.
When users visit Graphbook, they can log in and see their news feed and
chats. Another requirement for a social network is that users have their
own profile pages. We will also introduce client-side routing for our React application.

This lab will cover the following topics:

-   Installing React Router
-   Implementing routes
-   Securing routes
-   Manual navigation


### Lab Solution

Complete solution for this lab is available in the following directory:

`cd ~/Desktop/react-graphql-course/labs/Lab08`


Installing React Router
-----------------------

In the past, there were a lot of of React Router, with various
implementations and features. As we mentioned previously, we are going
to install and configure version 4 for this course. If you search for
other tutorials on this topic, make sure that you follow the
instructions for this version. Otherwise, you might miss some of the
changes that React Router has gone through.

To install React Router, simply run [npm] again, as follows:

```
npm install --save react-router-dom
```


The first step that we will take introduces a simple router to get our
current application working, including different paths for all of the
screens. The routes that we are going to add are as follows:

-   Our posts feed, chats, and the top bar, including the search box,
    should be accessible under the [/app] route of our
    application. The path is self-explanatory, but you could also use
    the [/] root as the main path.
-   The login and signup forms should have a separate path, which will
    be accessible under the root [/] path.
-   As we do not have any further screens, we also have to handle a
    situation in which none of the preceding routes match. In that case,
    we could display a so-called 404 page, but instead, we are going to
    redirect to the root path directly.

There is one thing that we have to prepare before continuing. For
development, we are using the webpack development server, as this is
what we configured in the Lab 1.
To get the routing working out of the box, we will add two parameters to
the [webpack.client.config.js] file. The [devServer] field
should look as follows:

```
devServer: {
  port: 3000,
  open: 'midori',
  historyApiFallback: true,
},
```


The [historyApiFallback] field tells the [devServer] to
serve the [index.html] file, not only for the root path,
[http://localhost:3000/], but also when it would typically receive
a 404 error (such as for paths like [http://localhost:3000/app]).
That happens when the path does not match a file or folder that is
normal when implementing routing.

The [output] field at the top of the [config] file must have
a [publicPath] property, as follows:

```
output: {
  path: path.join(__dirname, buildDirectory),
  filename: 'bundle.js',
  publicPath: '/',
},
```


The [publicPath] property tells webpack to prefix the bundle URL
to an absolute path, instead of a relative path. When this property is
not included, the browser cannot download the bundle when visiting the
sub-directories of our application, as we are implementing client-side
routing. Let\'s begin with the first path, and bind the central part of
our application, including the news feed, to the [/app] path.



Implementing your first route
-----------------------------

Before implementing the routing, we will clean up the [App.js]
file. Create a [Main.js] file next to the [App.js] file in
the [client] folder. Insert the following code:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Feed from './Feed';
import Chats from './Chats';
import Bar from './components/bar';
import CurrentUserQuery from './components/queries/currentUser';

export default class Main extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <CurrentUserQuery>
        <Bar changeLoginState={this.props.changeLoginState}/>
        <Feed />
        <Chats />
      </CurrentUserQuery>
    );
  }
}
```


As you might have noticed, the preceding code is pretty much the same as
the logged in condition inside the [App.js] file. The only change
is that the [changeLoginState] function is taken from the
properties, and is not directly a method of the component itself. That
is because we split this part out of the [App.js] and put it into
a separate file. This improves reusability for other components that we
are going to implement.

Now, open and replace the [render] method of the [App]
component to reflect those changes, as follows:

```
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Helmet>
        <title>Graphbook - Feed</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Newsfeed of all your friends   
         on Graphbook" />
      </Helmet>
      <Router loggedIn={this.state.loggedIn} changeLoginState=
       {this.changeLoginState}/>
    </div>
  )
}
```


If you compare the preceding method with the old one, you can see that
we have inserted a [Router] component, instead of directly
rendering either the posts feed or the login form. The original
components of the [App.js] file are now in the previously created
[Main.js] file. Here, we pass the [loggedIn] state variable
and the [changeLoginState] function to the [Router]
component. Remove the dependencies at the top, such as the [Chats]
and [Feed] components, because we won\'t use them anymore thanks
to the new [Main] component. Add the following line to the
dependencies of our [App.js] file:

```
import Router from './router';
```


To get this code working, we have to implement our custom [Router]
component first. Generally, it is easy to get the routing running with
React Router, and you are not required to separate the routing
functionality into a separate file, but, that makes it more readable. To
do this, create a new [router.js] file in the [client]
folder, next to the [App.js] file, with the following content:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import LoginRegisterForm from './components/loginregister';
import Main from './Main';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Redirect, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

export default class Routing extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/app" component={() => <Main changeLoginState=
          {this.props.changeLoginState}/>}/>
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    )
  }
}
```


At the top, we import all of the dependencies. They include the new
[Main] component and the [react-router] package. The
following is a quick explanation of all of the components that we are
importing from the React Router package:

-   [BrowserRouter] (or [Router], for short, as we called it
    here) is the component that keeps the URL in the address bar in sync
    with the UI; it handles all of the routing logic.
-   The [Switch] component forces the first matching [Route]
    or [Redirect] to be rendered. We need it to stop rerendering
    the UI if the user is already in the location to which a redirect is
    trying to navigate. I generally recommend that you use the
    [Switch] component, as it catches unforeseeable routing
    errors.
-   [Route] is the component that tries to match the given path to
    the URL of the browser. If this is the case, the [component]
    property is rendered. You can see in the preceding code snippet that
    we are not setting the [Main] component directly as a
    parameter; instead, we return it from a stateless function. That is
    required because the [component] property of a [Route]
    only accepts functions, and not a component object. This solution
    allows us to pass the [changeLoginState] function to the
    [Main] component.
-   [Redirect] navigates the browser to a given location. The
    component receives a property called [to], filled by a path
    starting with a [/]. We are going to use this component in the
    next section.

The problem with the preceding code is that we are only listening for
one route, which is [/app]. If you are not logged in, there will
be many errors that are not covered. The best thing to do would be to
redirect the user to the root path, where they can log in.



Secured routes
--------------

**Secured routes** represent a to specific paths that are only the is
authenticated, or has the correct authorization.

The recommended solution to implement secure routes in React Router
version 4 is to write a small, stateless function that conditionally
renders either a [Redirect] component or the component specified
on the route that requires an authenticated user. We extract the
[component] property of the route into the [Component]
variable, which is a renderable React object. Insert the following code
into the [router.js] file:

```
const PrivateRoute = ({ component: Component, ...rest }) => (
  <Route {...rest} render={(props) => (
    rest.loggedIn === true
      ? <Component {...props} />
      : <Redirect to={{
          pathname: '/',
        }} />
  )} />
)
```


We call the stateless function [PrivateRoute]. It returns a
standard [Route] component, which receives all of the properties
initially given to the [PrivateRoute] function. To pass all
properties, we use a destructuring assignment with the [\...rest]
syntax. Using the syntax inside of curly braces on a React component
passes all fields of the [rest] object as properties to the
component. The [Route] component is only rendered if the given
path is matched.

Furthermore, the rendered component is dependent on the user\'s
[loggedIn] state variable, which we have to pass. If the user is
logged in, we render the [Component] without any problems.
Otherwise, we redirect the user to the root path of our application
using the [Redirect] component.

Use the new [PrivateRoute] component in the [render] method
of the [Router] and replace the old [Route], as follows:

```
<PrivateRoute path="/app" component={() => <Main changeLoginState=
 {this.props.changeLoginState}/>} loggedIn={this.props.loggedIn}/>
```


Notice that we pass the [loggedIn] property by taking the value
from the properties of the [Router] itself. It initially receives
the [loggedIn] property from the [App] component that we
edited previously. The great thing is that the [loggedIn] variable
can be updated from the parent [App] component at any time. That
means that the [Redirect] component is rendered and the user is
automatically navigated to the login form (if the user logs out, for
example). We do not have to write separate logic to implement this
functionality.

However, we have now created a new problem. We redirect from
[/app] to [/] if the user is not logged in, but we do not
have any routes set up for the initial [\'/\'] path. It makes
sense for this path to either show the login form or to redirect the
user to [/app] if the user is logged in. The pattern for the new
component is the same as the preceding code for the [PrivateRoute]
component, but in the opposite direction. Add the new [LoginRoute]
component to the [router.js] file, as follows:

```
const LoginRoute = ({ component: Component, ...rest }) => (
  <Route {...rest} render={(props) => (
    rest.loggedIn === false
      ? <Component {...props} />
      : <Redirect to={{
          pathname: '/app',
        }} />
  )} />
)
```


The preceding condition is inverted to render the original component. If
the user is not logged in, the login form is rendered. Otherwise, they
will be redirected to the posts feed.

Add the new path to the router, as follows:

```
<LoginRoute exact path="/" component={() => <LoginRegisterForm changeLoginState={this.props.changeLoginState}/>} loggedIn={this.props.loggedIn}/>
```


The code looks the same as that of the [PrivateRoute] component,
except that we now have a new property, called [exact]. If we pass
this property to a route, the browser\'s location has to match one
hundred percent. The following table shows a quick example, taken from
the official React Router documentation:

![](./images/1.PNG)


For the root path, we set [exact] to true, because otherwise the
path matches with any browser\'s location where a [/] is included,
as you can see in the preceding table.

**ProTip**

There are many more configuration options that React Router offers, such
as enforcing trailing slashes, case sensitivity, and much more. You can
find all of the options and examples in the official documentation at
[ht](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/)[tps://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/).




Catch-all routes in React Router
--------------------------------

Currently, we have two paths set up, which are [/app] and
[/]. If a user visits a non-existent path, such as [/test],
they will see an empty screen. The solution is to implement a route that
matches any path. For simplicity, we redirect the user to the root of
our application, but you could easily replace the redirection with a
typical 404 page.

Add the following code to the [router.js] file:

```
class NotFound extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Redirect to="/"/> );
  }
}
```


The [NotFound] component is minimal. It just redirects the user to
the root path. Add the next [Route] component to the
[Switch] in the [Router]. Ensure that it is the last one on
the list:

```
<Route component={NotFound} />
```


As you can see, we are rendering a simple [Route] in the preceding
code. What makes the route special is that we are not passing a
[path] property with it. By default, the [path] is
completely ignored and the component is rendered every time, except if
there is a match with a previous component. That is why we added the
route to the bottom of the [Router]. When no route matches, we
redirect the user to the login screen in the root path, or, if the user
is already logged in, we redirect them to a different screen using the
routing logic of the root path. Our [LoginRoute] component handles
this last case.

You can test all changes when starting the front end with `npm run client` and the back end with `npm run server`. We have now
moved the current state of our application from a standard, single-route
application to an application that differentiates the login form and the
news feed based on the location of the browser.


Advanced routing with React Router
==================================

The primary goal of this lab is to build a profile page for your
users. We need a separate page to show all of the content that a single
user has entered or created. The content would not fit next to the posts
feed. When looking at Facebook, we can see that every user has their own
address, under which we can find the profile page of a specific user. We
are going to create our profile page in the same way, and use the
username as the custom path.

We have to implement the following features:

1.  We add a new parameterized route for the user profile. The path
    starts with [/user/] and follows a username.
2.  We change the user profile page to send all GraphQL queries,
    including the [username] route parameter, inside of the
    [variables] field of the GraphQL request.
3.  We edit the [postsFeed] query to filter all posts by the
    [username] parameter provided.
4.  We implement a new GraphQL query on the back end to request a user
    by their username, in order to show information about the user.
5.  When all of the queries are finished, we render a new user profile
    header component and the posts feed.
6.  Finally, we enable navigation between each page without reloading
    the complete page, but only the changed parts.

Let\'s start by implementing routing for the profile page in the next
section.



Parameters in routes
--------------------

We have prepared most of the work required to add a new user route. Open
up the [router.js] file again. Add the new route, as follows:

```
<PrivateRoute path="/user/:username" component={props => <User {...props} changeLoginState={this.props.changeLoginState}/>} loggedIn={this.props.loggedIn}/>
```


The code contains two new elements, as follows:

-   The path that we entered is [/user/:username]. As you can see,
    the username is prefixed with a colon, telling React Router to pass
    the value of it to the underlying component being rendered.
-   The component that we rendered previously was a stateless function
    that returned either the [LoginRegisterForm] or the
    [Main] component. Neither of these received any parameters or
    properties from React Router. Now, however, it is required that all
    properties of React Router are transferred to the child component.
    That includes the username parameter that we just introduced. We use
    the same destructuring assignment with the [props] object to
    pass all properties to the [User] component.

Those are all of the changes that we need to accept parameterized paths
in React Router. We read out the value inside of the new user page
component. Before implementing it, we import the dependency at the top
of [router.js] to get the preceding route working:

```
import User from './User';
```


Create the preceding [User.js] file next to the [Main.js]
file. Like the [Main] component, we are collecting all of the
components that we render on this page. You should stay with this
layout, as you can directly see which main parts each page consists of.
The [User.js] file should look as follows:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import UserProfile from './components/user';
import Chats from './Chats';
import Bar from './components/bar';
import CurrentUserQuery from './components/queries/currentUser';

export default class User extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <CurrentUserQuery>
        <Bar changeLoginState={this.props.changeLoginState}/>
        <UserProfile username={this.props.match.params.username}/>
        <Chats />
      </CurrentUserQuery>
    );
  }
}
```


Like before, we use the [CurrentUserQuery] component as a wrapper
for the [Bar] component and the [Chats] component. If a user
visits the profile of a friend, they see the common application bar at
the top. They can access their chats on the right-hand side, like in
Facebook. It is one of the many situations in which React and the
reusability of components come in handy.

We removed the [Feed] component and replaced it with a new
[UserProfile] component. Importantly, the [UserProfile]
receives the [username] property. Its value is taken from the
properties of the [User] component. These properties were passed
over by React Router. If you have a parameter, such as a
[username], in the routing path, the value is stored in the
[match.params.username] property of the child component. The
[match] object generally contains all matching information of
React Router.

From this point on, you can implement any custom logic that you want
with this value. We will now continue with implementing the profile
page.

Follow these steps to build the user\'s profile page:

1.  Create a new folder, called [user], inside the
    [components] folder.
2.  Create a new file, called `index.js`, inside the [user]
    folder.
3.  Import the dependencies at the top of the file, as follows:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PostsQuery from '../queries/postsFeed';
import FeedList from '../post/feedlist';
import UserHeader from './header';
import UserQuery from '../queries/userQuery';
```


The first three lines should look familiar. The last two imported files,
however, do not exist at the moment, but we are going to change that
shortly. The first new file is [UserHeader], which takes care of
rendering the avatar image, the name, and information about the user.
Logically, we request the data that we will display in this header
through a new Apollo query, called [UserQuery].

4.  Insert the code for the [UserProfile] component that we are
    building at the moment beneath the dependencies, as follows:

```
export default class UserProfile extends Component {
  render() {
    const query_variables = { page: 0, limit: 10, username: 
    this.props.username };
    return (
      <div className="user">
        <div className="inner">
          <UserQuery variables={{username: this.props.username}}>
            <UserHeader/>
          </UserQuery>
        </div>
        <div className="container">
          <PostsQuery variables={query_variables}>
            <FeedList/>
          </PostsQuery>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```


The [UserProfile] class is not complex. We are running two Apollo
queries simultaneously. Both have the [variables] property set.
The [PostQuery] receives the regular pagination fields,
[page] and [limit], but also the username, which initially
came from React Router. This property is also handed over to the
[UserQuery], inside of a [variables] object.

5.  We should now edit and create the Apollo queries, before programming
    the profile header component. Open the [postsFeed.js] file
    from the [queries] folder.

To use the username as input to the GraphQL query we first have to
change the query string from the [GET\_POSTS] variable. Change the
first two lines to match the following code:

```
query postsFeed($page: Int, $limit: Int, $username: String) { 
  postsFeed(page: $page, limit: $limit, username: $username) { 
```


Add a new line to the [getVariables] method, above the
[return] statement:

```
if(typeof variables.username !== typeof undefined) {
  query_variables.username = variables.username;
}
```


If the custom query component receives a [username] property, it
is included in the GraphQL request. It is used to filter posts by the
specific user that we are viewing.

6.  Create a new [userQuery.js] file in the [queries] folder
    to create the missing query class.
7.  Import all of the dependencies and parse the new query schema with
    [graphl-tag], as follows:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Query } from 'react-apollo';
import Loading from '../loading';
import Error from '../error';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

const GET_USER = gql`
  query user($username: String!) { 
    user(username: $username) { 
      id
      email
      username
      avatar
    }
  }
`;
```


The preceding query is nearly the same as the [currentUser] query.
We are going to implement the corresponding [user] query later, in
our GraphQL API.

8.  The component itself is as simple as the ones that we created
    before. Insert the following code:

```
export default class UserQuery extends Component {
  getVariables() {
    const { variables } = this.props;
    var query_variables = {};
    if(typeof variables.username !== typeof undefined) {
      query_variables.username = variables.username;
    }
    return query_variables;
  }
  render() {
    const { children } = this.props;
    const variables = this.getVariables();
    return(
      <Query query={GET_USER} variables={variables}>
        {({ loading, error, data }) => {
          if (loading) return <Loading />;
          if (error) return <Error><p>{error.message}</p></Error>;
          const { user } = data;
          return React.Children.map(children, function(child){
            return React.cloneElement(child, { user });
          })
        }}
      </Query>
    )
  }
}
```


We set the [query] property and the parameters that are collected
by the [getVariables] method to the GraphQL [Query]
component. The rest is the same as any other query component that we
have written. All child components receive a new property, called
[user], which holds all the information about the user, such as
their name, their email, and their avatar image. You can extend that
later on, but always remember to not publish data that should be
private.

9.  The last step is to implement the [UserProfileHeader]
    component. This component renders the [user] property, with
    all its values. It is just simple HTML markup. Copy the following
    code into the [header.js] file, in the [user] folder:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class UserProfileHeader extends Component {
  render() {
    const { avatar, email, username } = this.props.user;
    return (
      <div className="profileHeader">
        <div className="avatar">
          <img src={avatar}/>
        </div>
        <div className="information">
          <p>
            {username}
          </p>
          <p>
            {email}
          </p>
          <p>You can provide further information here and build 
          your really personal header component for your users.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```


If you need help getting the CSS styling right, take a look at the
official repository for this course. The preceding code only renders the
user\'s data; you could also implement features such as a chat button,
which would give the user the option to start messaging with other
people. Currently, we have not implemented this feature anywhere, but it
is not necessary to explain the principles of React and GraphQL.

We have finished the new front end components, but the
[UserProfile] component is still not working. The queries that we
are using here either do not accept the username parameter or have not
yet been implemented.

The next section will cover which parts of the back end have to be
adjusted.



Querying the user profile
-------------------------

With the new profile page, we have to update our back end accordingly.
Let\'s take a look at what needs to be done, as follows:

1.  We have to add the [username] parameter to the schema of the
    [postsFeed] query and adjust the resolver function.
2.  We have to create the schema and the resolver function for the new
    [UserQuery] component.

We will begin with the [postsFeed] query.

Edit the [postsFeed] query in the [RootQuery] type of the
[schema.js] file to match the following code:

```
postsFeed(page: Int, limit: Int, username: String): PostFeed @auth
```


Here, I have added the [username] as an optional parameter.

Now, head over to the [resolvers.js] file, and take a look at the
corresponding resolver function. Replace the signature of the function
to extract the username from the variables, as follows:

```
postsFeed(root, { page, limit, username }, context) {
```


To make use of the new parameter, add the following lines of code above
the return statement:

```
if(typeof username !== typeof undefined) {
  query.include = [{model: User}];
  query.where = { '$User.username$': username };
}
```


We have already covered the basic Sequelize API and how to query
associated models by using the [include] parameter in Lab 3. An important point is how we filter posts
associated with a user by their username:

1.  In the preceding code, we fill the [include] field of the
    [query] object with the Sequelize model that we want to join.
    This allows us to filter the associated [Chats] model in the
    next step.


2.  Then, we create a normal [where] object, in which we write the
    filter condition. If you want to filter the posts by an associated
    table of users, you can wrap the model and field names that you want
    to filter by with dollar signs. In our case, we wrap
    [User.username] with dollar signs, which tells Sequelize to
    query the [User] model\'s table and filter by the value of the
    [username] column.

No adjustments are required for the pagination part. The GraphQL query
is now ready. The great thing about the small changes that we have made
is that we have just one API function that accepts several parameters,
either to display posts on a single user profile, or to display a list
of posts like a news feed.

Let\'s move on and implement the new [user] query. Add the
following line to the [RootQuery] in your GraphQL schema:

```
user(username: String!): User @auth
```


This query only accepts a [username], but this time it is a
required parameter in the new query. Otherwise, the query would make no
sense, since we only use it when visiting a user\'s profile through
their username. In the [resolvers.js] file, we will now implement
the resolver function using Sequelize:

```
user(root, { username }, context) {
  return User.findOne({
    where: {
      username: username
    }
  });
},
```


In the preceding code, we use the [findOne] method of the
[User] model by Sequelize, and search for exactly one user with
the username that we provided in the parameter.

We also want to display the email of the user on the user\'s profile
page. Add the email as a valid field on the [User] type in your
GraphQL schema with the following line of code:

```
email: String
```


Now that the back end code and the user page are ready, we have to allow
the user to navigate to this new page. The next section will cover user
navigation using React Router.



Programmatic navigation in React Router
---------------------------------------

We created a new site with the user profile, but now we have to offer
the user a link to get there. The transition between the news feed and
the login and registration forms is automated by React Router, but not
the transition from the news feed to a profile page. The user decides
whether they want to view the profile of the user. React Router has
multiple ways to handle navigation. We are going to extend the news feed
to handle clicks on the username or the avatar image, in order to
navigate to the user\'s profile page. Open the [header.js] file in
the [post] components folder. Import the [Link] component
provided by React Router, as follows:

```
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```


The [Link] component is a tiny wrapper around a regular HTML
[a] tag. Apparently, in standard PHP applications or websites,
there is no complex logic behind hyperlinks; you click on them, and a
new page is loaded from scratch. With React Router or most single-page
application JS frameworks, you can add more logic behind hyperlinks.
Importantly, instead of completely reloading the pages when navigating
between different routes, this now gets handled by React Router. There
won\'t be complete page reloads when navigating; instead, only the
required parts are exchanged, and the GraphQL queries are run. This
method saves the user expensive bandwidth, because it means that we can
avoid downloading all of the HTML, CSS, and image files again.

To test this, wrap the username and the avatar image in the [Link]
component, as follows:

```
<Link to={'/user/'+post.user.username}>
  <img src={post.user.avatar} />
  <div>
    <h2>{post.user.username}</h2>
  </div>
</Link>
```


In the rendered HTML, the [img] and [div] tags are
surrounded by a common [a] tag, but are handled inside React
Router. The [Link] component receives a [to] property, which
is the destination of the navigation. You have to copy one new CSS rule,
because the [Link] component has changed the markup:

```
.post .header a > * {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```


If you test the changes now, clicking on the username or avatar image,
you should notice that the content of the page dynamically changes, but
does not entirely reload. A further task would be to copy this approach
to the user search list in the application bar and the chats. Currently,
the users are displayed, but there is no option to visit their profile
pages by clicking on them.

Now, let\'s take a look at another way to navigate with React Router. If
the user has reached a profile page, we want them to navigate back by
clicking on a button in the application bar. First of all, we will
create a new [home.js] file in the [bar] folder, and we will
enter the following code:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { withRouter } from 'react-router';

class Home extends Component {
  goHome = () => {
    this.props.history.push('/app');
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <button className="goHome" onClick={this.goHome}>Home</button>
    );
  }
}

export default withRouter(Home);
```


The [withRouter] HoC gives the [Home] component access to the
[history] object of React Router. That is great, because it means
that we do not need to pass this object from the top of our React tree
down to the [Home] component.

Furthermore, we use the [history] object to navigate the user to
the news feed. In the [render] method, we return a button, which,
when clicked, runs the [history.push] function. This function adds
the new path to the history of the browser and navigates the user to the
[\'/app\'] main page. The good thing is that it works in the same
way as the [Link] component, and does not reload the entire
website.

There are a few things to do in order to get the button working, as
follows:

1.  Import the component into the `index.js` file of the
    [bar] folder, as follows:

```
import Home from './home';
```


2.  Then, replace the [Logout] button with the following lines of
    code:

```
<div className="buttons">
  <Home/>
  <Logout changeLoginState={this.props.changeLoginState}/>
</div>
```


3.  I have wrapped the two buttons in a separate [div] tag, so
    that it is easier to align them correctly. You can replace the old
    CSS for the logout button and add the following:

```
.topbar .buttons {
  position: absolute;
  right: 5px;
  top: 5px;
  height: calc(100% - 10px);
}

.topbar .buttons > * {
  height: 100%;
  margin-right: 5px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```


Now that we have everything together, the user can visit the profile
page and navigate back again. Our final result looks as follows:


![](./images/9383ad8d-caae-44bb-a57d-89a16edbdc94.png)


We have a big profile header for the user and their posts at the bottom
of the window. At the top, you can see the top bar with the currently
logged in user.



Remembering the redirect location
---------------------------------

Open the [router.js] file. With all of the routing components
provided by React Router, we always get access to the properties inside
of them. We will make use of this and save the last location that we
were redirected from.

In the [PrivateRoute] component, swap out the [Redirect]
with the following code:

```
<Redirect to={{
  pathname: '/',
  state: { from: props.location }
}} />
```


Here, I have added the [state] field. The value that it receives
comes from the parent [Route] component, which holds the last
matched path in the [props.location] field generated by React
Router. The path can be a user\'s profile page or the news feed, since
both rely on the [PrivateRoute] component where authentication is
required. When the preceding redirect is triggered, you receive the
[from] field inside of the router\'s state.

We want to use this variable when the user is logging in. Replace the
[Redirect] component in the [LoginRoute] component with the
following lines:

```
<Redirect to={{
  pathname: (typeof props.location.state !== typeof undefined) ? 
  props.location.state.from.pathname : '/app',
}} />
```


Here, I have introduced a small condition for the [pathname]. If
the [location.state] property is defined, we can rely on the
[from] field. Previously, we stored the redirect path in the
[PrivateRoute] component. If the [location.state] property
does not exist, the user was not visiting a direct hyperlink, but just
wanted to log in normally. They will be navigated to the news feed with
the [/app] path.

Your application should now be able to handle all routing scenarios, and
this should allow your users to view your site comfortably.


Summary
=======

In this lab, we transitioned from our one-screen application to a
multi-page setup. React Router, our main library for routing purposes,
now has three paths, under which we display different parts of
Graphbook. Furthermore, we now have a catch-all route, in which we can
redirect the user to a valid page.

We will continue with this progression by implementing server-side
rendering, which needs many adjustments on both the front end and the
back end.
