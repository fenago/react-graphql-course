Testing with Mocha
==================



To get started, we have to install all the dependencies to test our
application with npm:

```
npm install --save-dev mocha chai @babel/polyfill request
```


The [mocha] package includes almost everything to run tests. Along
with Mocha, we also install [chai], which is an assertion library.
It offers excellent ways to chain tests with many variables and types
for use inside a Mocha test. We also install the
[\@babel/polyfill] package, which allows our test to support
ES2015+ syntax. This package is crucial because we use this syntax
everywhere throughout our React code. Finally, we install the
[request] package as a library to send all the queries or
mutations within our test. I recommend you set the [NODE\_ENV]
environment variable to [production] to test every functionality,
as in a live environment. Be sure that you set the environment variable
correctly so that all production features are used.



Our first Mocha test
--------------------

First, let\'s add a new command to the [scripts] field of our
[package.json] file:

```
"test": "mocha --exit test/ --require babel-hook --require @babel/polyfill --recursive"
```


If you now execute `npm run test`, we\'ll run the [mocha]
package in the [test] folder, which we\'ll create in a second. The
preceding [\--require] option loads the specified file or package.
We\'ll also load a [babel-hook.js] file, which we\'ll create as
well. The [\--recursive] parameter tells Mocha to run through the
complete file tree of the [test] folder, not just the first layer.
This behavior is useful because it allows us to structure our tests in
multiple files and folders.

Let\'s begin with the [babel-hook.js] file by adding it to the
root of our project, next to the [package.json] file. Insert the
following code:

```
require("@babel/register")({
  "plugins": [
    "require-context-hook"
  ],
  "presets": ["@babel/env","@babel/react"]
});
```


The purpose of this file is to give us an alternative Babel
configuration file to our standard [.babelrc] file. If you compare
both files, you should see that we use the [require-context-hook]
plugin. We already use this plugin when starting the back end with [npm
run server]. It allows us to import our Sequelize models using a
regular expression.

If we start our test with `npm run test`, we require this file at
the beginning. Inside the [babel-hook.js] file, we load
[\@babel/register], which compiles all the files that are imported
afterward in our test according to the preceding configuration.



This gives us the option to start our back end server from within our
test file and render our application on the server. The preparation for
our test is now finished. Create a folder named [test] inside the
root of our project to hold all runnable tests. Mocha will scan all
files or folders, and all tests will be executed. To get a basic test
running, create [app.test.js]. This is the main file, which makes
sure that our back end is running and in which we can subsequently
define further tests. The first version of our test looks as follows:

```
const assert = require('assert');
const request = require('request');
const expect = require('chai').expect;
const should = require('chai').should();

describe('Graphbook application test', function() {

  it('renders and serves the index page', function(done) {
    request('http://localhost:8000', function(err, res, body) {
      should.not.exist(err);
      should.exist(res);
      expect(res.statusCode).to.be.equal(200);
      assert.ok(body.indexOf('<html') !== -1);
      done(err);
    });
  });

});
```


Let\'s take a closer look at what\'s happening here:

1.  We import the Node.js [assert] function. It gives us the
    ability to verify the value or the type of a variable.
2.  We import the [request] package, which we use to send queries
    against our back end.
3.  We import two Chai functions, [expect] and [should],
    from the [chai] package. Neither of these is included in
    Mocha, but they both improve the test\'s functionality
    significantly.
4.  The beginning of the test starts with the [describe] function.
    Because Mocha executes the [app.test.js] file, we\'re in the
    correct scope and can use all Mocha functions. The [describe]
    function is used to structure your test and its output.
5.  We use the [it] function, which initiates the first test.


The [describe] function is the header of our test\'s output. Then,
we have a new row for each [it] function we execute. Each row
represents a single test step. The [it] function passes a
[done] function to the callback. The [done] function has to
be executed once all assertions are finished and there\'s nothing left
to do. If it isn\'t executed in a certain amount of time, the current
test is marked as failed. In the preceding code, the first thing we did
was send an HTTP [GET] request to [http://localhost:8000],
which is accepted by our back end server. The expected answer will be in
the form of server-side rendered HTML created through React.


If you execute `npm run test` now, you\'ll receive the following error:


![](./images/13f8b682-82cf-4989-9677-9ccdb4b7b970.png)


Our first [should.not.exist] assertion failed and threw an error.
This is because we didn\'t start the back end when we ran the test.
Start the back end in a second terminal with the correct environment
variables using `npm run server` and rerun the test. Now, the test
is successful:


![](./images/d51476d7-8610-4554-8b0a-0fa0b7014617.png)


The output is good, but the process isn\'t very intuitive. The current
workflow is hard to implement when running the tests automatically while
deploying your application or pushing new commits to your
version-control system. We\'ll change this behavior next.



Starting the back end with Mocha
--------------------------------

When we want to run a test, the server should start automatically. There
are two options to implement this behavior:

-   We add the `npm run server` command to the [test] script
    inside our [package.json] file.
-   We import all the necessary files to launch the server within our
    [app.test.js]. This allows us to run further assertions or
    commands against the back end.

The best option is to start the server within our test and not rely on a
second command, because we can run further tests on the back end. We to
import a further package to allow the server to start within our test:

```
require('babel-plugin-require-context-hook/register')();
```


We use and execute this package because we load the Sequelize models
using the [require.context] function. By loading the package, the
[require.context] function is executable for the server-side code.
Before we started the server within the test, the plugin hadn\'t been
used, although it was loaded in the [babel-hooks.js] file.

Now we can load the server directly in the test. Add the following lines
at the top of the [describe] function, just before the test we\'ve
just written:

```
var app;
this.timeout(50000);

before(function(done) {
  app = require('../src/server').default;
  app.on("listening", function() {
    done();
  });
});
```


The idea is to load the server\'s `index.js` file inside of our
test, which starts the back end automatically. To do this, we define an
empty variable called [app]. Then, we use [this.timeout] to
set the timeout for all tests inside Mocha to [50000], because
starting our server, including Apollo Server, takes some time.
Otherwise, the test will probably fail because the start time is too
long for the standard Mocha timeout.

We must make sure that the server has been completely started before any
of our tests are executed. This logic can be achieved with Mocha\'s
[before] function. Using this function, you can set up and
configure things such as starting a back end in our scenario. To
continue and process all the tests, we need to execute the [done]
function to complete the callback of the [before] function. To be
sure that the server has started, we do not just run the [done]
function after loading the `index.js` file. We bind the
[listening] event of the server using the [app.on] function.
If the server emits the [listening] event, we can securely run the
[done] function, and all tests can send requests to the server. We
could also require the server directly into the [app] variable at
the top. The problem with this order, however, is that the server may
start listening before we can bind the [listening] event. The way
we are doing it now makes sure the server hasn\'t yet started.

The test, however, still isn\'t working. You\'ll see an error message
that says [\'TypeError: app.on is not a function\']. Take a closer
look at the server\'s `index.js` file. At the end of the file, we
aren\'t exporting the server object because we only used it to start the
back end. This means that the [app] variable in our test is empty
and we can\'t run the [app.on] function. The solution is to export
the [server] object at the end of the server\'s `index.js`
file:

```
export default server;
```


You can now execute the test again. Everything should look fine, and all
tests should pass.

There is, however, one last problem. If you compare the behavior from
the test before importing the server directly in our test or starting it
in a second terminal, you might notice that the test isn\'t finished, or
at least the process isn\'t stopped. Previously, all steps were
executed, we returned to the normal shell, and we could execute the next
command. The reason for this is that the server is still running in our
[app.test.js] file. Therefore, we must stop the back end after all
tests have been executed. Insert the following code after the
[before] function:

```
after(function(done) {
  app.close(done);
});
```


The [after] function is run when all tests are finished. Our
[app] object offers the [close] function, which terminates
the server. As a callback, we hand over the [done] function, which
is executed once the server has stopped. It means that our test has also
finished.



Verifying the correct routing
-----------------------------

We now want to check whether all the features of our application are
working as expected. One major feature of our application is that React
Router redirects the user in two cases:

-   The user visits a route that cannot be matched.
-   The user visits a route that can be matched, but they aren\'t
    allowed to view the page.

In both cases, the user should be redirected to the login form. In the
first case, we can follow the same approach as for our first test. We
send a request to a path that isn\'t inside our router. Add the code to
the bottom of the [describe] function:

```
describe('404', function() {
  it('redirects the user when not matching path is found', function(done) {
    request({
      url: 'http://localhost:8000/path/to/404',
    }, function(err, res, body) {
      should.not.exist(err);
      should.exist(res);
      expect(res.statusCode).to.be.equal(200);
      assert.ok(res.req.path === '/');
      assert.ok(body.indexOf('<html') !== -1);
      assert.ok(body.indexOf('class="authModal"') !== -1);
      done(err);
    });
  });
});
```


Let\'s quickly go through all steps of the preceding test:

1.  We add a new [describe] function to structure our test\'s
    output.
2.  We send a request inside another [it] function to an unmatched
    path.
3.  The checks are the same as the ones we used when starting the
    server.
4.  We verify that the response\'s path is the [/] root. That
    happens when the redirect is executed. Therefore, we use the
    [res.req.path === \'/\'] condition.
5.  We check whether the returned [body] includes an HTML tag with
    the [authModal] class. This should happen when the user isn\'t
    logged in, and the login or register form is rendered.

If the assertions are successful, we know that the React Router works
correctly in the first scenario. The second scenario relates to the
private routes that can only be accessed by authenticated users. We can
copy the preceding check and replace the request. The assertions we are
doing stay the same, but the URL of the request is different. Add the
following test under the previous one:

```
describe('authentication', function() {
  it('redirects the user when not logged in', function(done) {
    request({
      url: 'http://localhost:8000/app',
    }, function(err, res, body) {
      should.not.exist(err);
      should.exist(res);
      expect(res.statusCode).to.be.equal(200);
      assert.ok(res.req.path === '/');
      assert.ok(body.indexOf('<html') !== -1);
      assert.ok(body.indexOf('class="authModal"') !== -1);
      done(err);
    });
  });
});
```


If an unauthenticated user requests the [/app] route, they\'re
redirected to the [/] root path. The assertions verify whether the
login form is displayed as before. To differentiate the tests, we add a
new [describe] function so that it has a better structure.

Next, we want to test the GraphQL API that we built, not only the SSR
functionality.


Testing GraphQL with Mocha
==========================

We must verify that all the API functions we\'re offering work
correctly. I\'m going to show you how to do this with two examples:

-   The user needs to sign up or log in. This is a critical feature
    where we should verify that the API works correctly.
-   The user queries or mutates data via the GraphQL API. For our test
    case, we will request all chats the logged-in user is related to.

Those two examples should explain all the essential techniques to test
every part of your API. You can add more functions that you want to test
at any point.



Testing the authentication
--------------------------

We extend the authentication tests of our test with the signup
functionality. We\'re going to send a simple GraphQL request to our back
end, including all the required data to sign up a new user. We\'ve
already sent requests, so there\'s nothing new here. In comparison to
all the requests before, however, we have to send a [POST]
request, not a [GET] request. Also, the endpoint for the signup is
the [/graphql] path, where our Apollo Server listens for incoming
mutations or queries. Normally, when a user signs up for Graphbook, the
authentication token is returned directly, and the user is logged in. We
must preserve this token to make future GraphQL requests. We don\'t use
Apollo Client for our test as we don\'t need to test the GraphQL API.

Create a global variable next to the [app] variable, where we can
store the JWT returned after signup:

```
var authToken;
```


Inside the test, we can set the returned JWT. Add the following code to
the [authentication] function:

```
it('allows the user to sign up', function(done) {
  const json = {
    operationName: null,
    query: "mutation signup($username: String!, $email : String!, 
    $password : String!) { signup(username: $username, email: $email,   
    password : $password) { token }}",
    variables: {
      "email": "mocha@test.com",
      "username": "mochatest",
      "password": "123456789"
    }
  };

  request.post({
    url: 'http://localhost:8000/graphql',
    json: json,
  }, function(err, res, body) {
    should.not.exist(err);
    should.exist(res);
    expect(res.statusCode).to.be.equal(200);
    body.should.be.an('object');
    body.should.have.property('data');
    authToken = body.data.signup.token;
    done(err);
  });
});
```


We begin by creating a [json] variable. This object is sent as a
JSON body to our GraphQL API. The content of it should be familiar to
you. It\'s nearly the same format we used when testing the GraphQL API
in Postman.

**ProTip**

The JSON we send represents a manual way of sending GraphQL requests.
There are libraries that you can easily use to save this and directly
send the query without wrapping it inside an object, such as
[graphql-request]: <https://github.com/prisma/graphql-request>.


The [json] object includes fake signup [variables] to create
a user with the [mochatest] username. We\'ll send an HTTP
[Post] with the [request.post] function. To use the
[json] variable, we pass it into the [json] field. The
[request.post] function automatically adds the body as a JSON
string and the correct [Content-Type] header for you. When the
response arrives, we run the standard checks, such as checking for an
error or checking an HTTP status code. We also check the format of the
returned [body], because the response\'s [body] won\'t
return HTML, but will return JSON instead. We make sure that it\'s an
object with the [should.be.an(\'object\')] function. The
[should] assertion can directly be used and chained to the
[body] variable. If [body] is an object, we check whether
there\'s a [data] property inside. That\'s enough security to read
the token from the [body.data.signup.token] property.

The user is now created in our database. We can use this token for
further requests. Be aware that running this test a second time on your
local machine is likely to result in a failure because the user already
exists. In this case, you can delete it manually from your database.
This problem won\'t occur when running this test while using Continuous
Integration. We\'ll focus on this topic in the last lab. Next,
we\'ll make an authenticated query to our Apollo Server and test the
result of it.



Testing authenticated requests
------------------------------

We set the [authToken] variable after the signup request. You
could also do this with a login request if a user already exists while
testing. Only the query and the assertions we are using are going to
change. Also insert the following code into the [before]
authentication function:

```
it('allows the user to query all chats', function(done) {
  const json = {
    operationName: null,
    query: "query {chats {id users {id avatar username}}}",
    variables: {}
  };

  request.post({
    url: 'http://localhost:8000/graphql',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': authToken
    },
    json: json,
  }, function(err, res, body) {
    should.not.exist(err);
    should.exist(res);
    expect(res.statusCode).to.be.equal(200);
    body.should.be.an('object');
    body.should.have.property('data');
    body.data.should.have.property('chats').with.lengthOf(0);
    done(err);
  });
});
```


As you can see in the preceding code, the [json] object doesn\'t
include any variables because we only query the chats of the logged-in
user. We changed the [query] string accordingly. Compared to the
login or signup request, the chat query requires the user to be
authenticated. The [authToken] we saved is sent inside the
[Authorization] header. We now verify again whether the request
was successful and check for a [data] property in the
[body]. Notice that, before running the [done] function, we
verify that the [data] object has a field called [chats]. We
also check the length of the [chats] field, which proves that
it\'s an array. The length can be statically set to [0] because
the user who\'s sending the query just signed up and doesn\'t have any
chats yet. The output from Mocha looks as follows:


![](./images/68e5435e-931c-4c96-b04b-6fe41bd95492.png)


This is all you need to know to test all the features of your API.


Testing React with Enzyme
=========================

So far, we\'ve managed to test our server and all GraphQL API functions.
Currently, however, we\'re still missing the tests for our front end
code. While we render the React code when requesting any server route,
such as the [/app] path, we only have access to the final result
and not to each component. We should change this to execute the
functions of certain components that aren\'t testable through the back
end. First, install some dependencies before using npm:

```
npm install --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 ignore-styles jsdom isomorphic-fetch
```


The various packages are as follows:

-   The [enzyme] and [enzyme-adapter-react-16] packages
    provide React with specific features to render and interact with the
    React tree. This can either be through a real DOM or shallow
    rendering. We are going to use a real DOM in this lab because it
    allows us to test all features, while shallow rendering is limited
    to just the first layer of components.
-   The [ignore-styles] package strips out all [import]
    statements for CSS files. This is very helpful, since we don\'t need
    CSS for our tests.
-   The [jsdom] package creates a DOM object for us, which is then
    used to render the React code into.
-   The [isomorphic-fetch] package replaces the [fetch]
    function that all browsers provide by default. This isn\'t available
    in Node.js, so we need a polyfill.

We start by importing the new packages directly under the other
[require] statements:

```
require('isomorphic-fetch');
import React from 'react';
import { configure, mount } from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';
configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
import register from 'ignore-styles';
register(['.css', '.sass', '.scss']);
```


To use Enzyme, we import React. Then, we create an adapter for Enzyme
that supports React 16. We insert the adapter into Enzyme\'s
[configure] statement. Before starting with the front end code, we
import the [ignore-styles] package to ignore all CSS imports.
I\'ve also directly excluded SASS and SCSS files. The next step is to
initialize our DOM object, where all the React code is rendered:

```
const { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');
const dom = new JSDOM('<!doctype html><html><body></body></html>', { url: 'http://graphbook.test' });
const { window } = dom;
global.window = window;
global.document = window.document;
```


We require the [jsdom] package and initialize it with a small HTML
string. We don\'t take the template file that we\'re using for the
server or client because we just want to render our application to any
HTML, so how it looks isn\'t important. The second parameter is an
options object. We specify a [url] field, which is the host URL,
under which we render the React code. Otherwise, we might get an error
when accessing `localStorage`. After initialization, we extract
the [window] object and define two global variables that are
required to mount a React component to our fake DOM. These two
properties behave like the [document] and [window] objects
in the browser, but instead of the browser they are global objects
inside our Node.js server.

In general, it isn\'t a good idea to mix up the Node.js [global]
object with the DOM of a browser and render a React application in it.
Still, we\'re merely testing our application and not running it in
production in this environment, so while it might not be recommended, it
helps our test to be more readable. We\'ll begin the first front end
test with our login form. The visitor to our page can either directly
log in or switch to the signup form. Currently, we don\'t test this
switch functionality in any way. This is a complex example, but you
should be able to understand the techniques behind it quickly.

To render our complete React code, we\'re going to initialize an Apollo
Client for our test. Import all the dependencies:

```
import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client';
import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';
import { ApolloLink } from 'apollo-link';
import { createUploadLink } from 'apollo-upload-client';
import App from '../src/server/ssr';
```


We also import the `index.js` component of the server-rendered
React code. This component will receive our client, which we\'ll
initialize shortly. Add a new [describe] function for all front
end tests:

```
describe('frontend', function() {
  it('renders and switches to the login or register form', 
  function(done) {
    const httpLink = createUploadLink({
      uri: 'http://localhost:8000/graphql',
      credentials: 'same-origin',
    });
    const client = new ApolloClient({
      link: ApolloLink.from([
        httpLink
      ]),
      cache: new InMemoryCache()
    });
  });
});
```


The preceding code creates a new Apollo Client. The client doesn\'t
implement any logic, such as authentication or WebSockets, because we
don\'t need this to test the switch from the login form to the signup
form. It\'s merely a required property to render our application
completely. If you want to test components that are only rendered when
being authenticated, you can, of course, implement it easily. Enzyme
requires us to pass a real React component, which will be rendered to
the DOM. Add the following code directly beneath the [client]
variable:

```
class Graphbook extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return(
      <App client={client} context={{}} loggedIn={false} location=
       {"/"}/>
    )
  }
}
```


The preceding code is a small wrapper around the [App] variable
that we imported from the server\'s [ssr] folder. The
[client] property is filled with the new Apollo Client. Follow the
given instructions to render and test your React front end code. The
following code goes directly under the [Graphbook] class:

1.  We use the [mount] function of Enzyme to render the
    [Graphbook] class to the DOM:

```
const wrapper = mount(<Graphbook />);
```


2.  The [wrapper] variable provides many functions to access or
    interact with the DOM and the components inside it. We use it to
    prove that the first render displays the login form:

```
expect(wrapper.html()).to.contain('<a>Want to sign up? Click here</a>');
```


The [html] function of the [wrapper] variable returns the
complete HTML string that has been rendered by the React code. We check
this string with the [contain] function of Chai. If the check is
successful, we can continue.

3.  Typically, the user clicks on the [Want to sign up?]
    message and React rerenders the signup form. We need to handle this
    via the [wrapper] variable. Enzyme comes with that
    functionality innately:

```
wrapper.find('LoginRegisterForm').find('a').simulate('click');
```


The [find] function gives us access to the
[LoginRegisterForm] component. Inside the markup of the component,
we search for an [a] tag, of which there can only be one. If the
[find] method returns multiple results, we can\'t trigger things
such as a click, because the [simulate] function is fixed to only
one possible target. After running both [find] functions, we
execute Enzyme\'s [simulate] function. The only parameter needed
is the event that we want to trigger. In our scenario, we trigger a
click event on the [a] tag, which lets React handle all the rest.

4.  We check whether the form was changed correctly:

```
expect(wrapper.html()).to.contain('<a>Want to login? Click 
 here</a>');
done();
```


We use the [html] and [contain] functions to verify that
everything was rendered correctly. The [done] method of Mocha is
used to finish the test.

**ProTip**

For a more detailed overview of the API and all the functions that
Enzyme provides, have a look at the official documentation:
<https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/>.


This was the easy part. How does this work when we want to verify
whether the client can send queries or mutations with authentication?
It\'s actually not that different. We already registered a new user and
got a JWT in return. All we need to do is attach the JWT to our Apollo
Client, and the Router needs to receive the correct [loggedIn]
property. The final code for this test looks as follows:

```
it('renders the current user in the top bar', function(done) {
  const AuthLink = (operation, next) => {
    operation.setContext(context => ({
        ...context,
        headers: {
            ...context.headers,
            Authorization: authToken
        },
    }));
    return next(operation);
  };

  const httpLink = createUploadLink({
    uri: 'http://localhost:8000/graphql',
    credentials: 'same-origin',
  });

  const client = new ApolloClient({
    link: ApolloLink.from([
      AuthLink,
      httpLink
    ]),
    cache: new InMemoryCache()
  });

  class Graphbook extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return(
        <App client={client} context={{}} loggedIn={true} location=
         {"/app"}/>
      )
    }
  }

  const wrapper = mount(<Graphbook />);
  setTimeout(function() {
    expect(wrapper.html()).to.contain('<div class="user"><img>
     <span>mochatest</span></div>');
    done();
  },2000);
});
```


Here, we are using the `AuthLink` that we used in the original
front end code. We pass the `authToken` variable to every request
that\'s made by the Apollo Client. In the `Apollo.from` method, we
add it before `httpLink`. In the `Graphbook` class, we set
`loggedIn` to `true` and the `location` to
`/app` to render the newsfeed. Because the requests are
asynchronous by default and the `mount` method doesn\'t wait for
the Apollo Client to fetch all queries, we couldn\'t directly check the
DOM for the correct content. Instead, we wrapped the assertions and the
`done` function in a `setTimeout` function. A timeout of
2,000 milliseconds should be enough for all requests to finish and React
to have rendered everything. If this isn\'t enough time, you can
increase the number. When all assertions are successful, we can be sure
that the `currentUser` query has been run and the top bar has been
rendered to show the logged-in user. With these two examples, you should
now be able to run any test you want with your application\'s front end
code.


Summary
=======

In this lab, we learned all the essential techniques to test your
application automatically, including testing the server, the GraphQL
API, and the user\'s front end. You can apply the Mocha and Chai
patterns you learned to other projects to reach a high software quality
at any time. Your personal testing time will be greatly reduced.

In the next lab, we\'ll have a look at how to improve performance
and error logging so we\'re always providing a good user experience.
