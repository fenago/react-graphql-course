#### Lab 11.0: GraphQL - Caching


Client applications interacting with GraphQL are responsible for caching
data at their end. One possible pattern for this is reserving a field,
like id, to be a globally unique identifier.

InMemory Cache
--------------

InMemoryCache is a normalized data store commonly used in GraphQL client
applications without use of other library like Redux.

The sample code to use InMemoryCache with ApolloClient is given below −

```
import {ApolloClient, HttpLink, InMemoryCache} from 'apollo-boost'
const cache = new InMemoryCache();

const client = new ApolloClient({
   link: new HttpLink(),
   cache
});
```

The InMemoryCache constructor takes an optional config object with
properties to customize your cache.



#### Parameter & Description

**addTypename** A boolean to determine whether to add \_\_typename to the document
(default: true)

**dataIdFromObject** A function that takes a data object and returns a unique identifier to
be used when normalizing the data in the store

**fragmentMatcher** By default, the InMemoryCache uses a heuristic fragment matcher


**cacheRedirects** A map of functions to redirect a query to another entry in the cache
before a request takes place.

Illustration
------------

We will create a single page application in ReactJS with two tabs – one
for the home tab and another for students. The students tab will load
data from a GraphQL server API. The application will query for
*students* data when the user navigates from the home tab to the
students tab. The resulting data will be cached by the application.

We will also query the server time using **getTime** field to verify if
the page is cached. If data is returned from the cache, the page will
display the time of very first request sent to the server. If the data
is a result of a fresh request made to the sever, it will always show
the latest time from server.

Setting up the Server
---------------------

Following are the steps for setting up the server −

### Step 1 − Download and Install Required Dependencies for the Project

Create a folder **cache-server-app**. Change your directory
to **cache-server-app** from the terminal. Follow steps 3 to 5 explained
in the `Lab 1.0`.

### Step 2 − Create a Schema

Add **schema.graphql** file in the project folder **cache-server-app**
and add the following code −

```
type Query {
   students:[Student]
   getTime:String
}

type Student {
   id:ID!
   firstName:String
   lastName:String
   fullName:String
}
```

### Step 3 − Add Resolvers

Create a file resolvers.js in the project folder, and add the following
code −

```
const db = require('./db')

const Query = {
      students:() => db.students.list(),
      getTime:() => {
      const today = new Date();
      var h = today.getHours();
      var m = today.getMinutes();
      var s = today.getSeconds();
      return `${h}:${m}:${s}`;
   }
}
module.exports = {Query}
```

### Step 4 − Run the Application

Create a server.js file. Refer step 8 in the `Lab 1.0`.
Execute the command *npm start* in the terminal. The server will be up
and running on 9000 port. Here, we will use GraphiQL as a client to test
the application.

Open browser and enter the URL **http://localhost:9000/graphiql**. Type
the following query in the editor −

```
{
   getTime
   students {
      id
      firstName
   }
}
```

The sample response shows the students names and the server time.

```
{
   "data": {
      "getTime": "22:18:42",
      "students": [
         {
            "id": "S1001",
            "firstName": "Ernesto"
         },
         {
            "id": "S1002",
            "firstName": "Khalil"
         },
         {
            "id": "S1003",
            "firstName": "Jordan"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

Setting up the ReactJS Client
-----------------------------

Open a new terminal for client. The server terminal should be kept
running before executing the client application. React application will
be running on port number 3000 and server application on port number
9000.

### Step 1 − Create a React Application

In the client terminal, type the following command −

```
npx create-react-app hello-world-client
```

This will install everything needed for a typical react application. The
**npx utility** and **create-react-app** tools create a project with
name hello-world-client. Once the installation is completed, open the
project in VSCode.

Install router modules for react using following command – **npm install
react-router-dom**.

### Step 2 − Start hello-world-client

Change the current folder path in the terminal to hello-world-client.
Type following to launch the project. This will run a development server
at port 3000. Open Midori browser and load the index page.


```
cd hello-world-client

npm install -g serve

npm run-script build

serve -s build
```

### Step 3 − Install Apollo Client Libraries

To install an Apollo Client, open a new terminal and be in current
project folder path. Type the following command −

```
npm install apollo-boost graphql
```

This will download the graphql libraries for client side and also the
Apollo Boost package. We can cross verify this by typing npm view
apollo-boost dependencies. This will have many dependencies as shown
below −

```
{ 
   'apollo-cache': '^1.1.15',
   'apollo-cache-inmemory': '^1.2.8',
   'apollo-client': '^2.4.0',
   'apollo-link': '^1.0.6',
   'apollo-link-error': '^1.0.3',
   'apollo-link-http': '^1.3.1',
   'apollo-link-state': '^0.4.0',
   'graphql-tag': '^2.4.2' 
}
```

We can clearly see that apollo-client library is installed.

### Step 4 − Modify the App Component in index.js File

For a simple react application, you only need to keep the **index.js**
in **src** folder and **index.html** in public folder; all other files
that are auto generated can be removed.

The directory structure is given below −

```
hello-world-client /
   -->node_modules
   -->public
      index.html
   -->src
      index.js
      students.js
   -->package.json
```

Add an additional file students.js which will contain Students
Component. Student details are fetched through the Student Component. In
the App Component, we are using a HashRouter.

Following is the **index.js** in react application −

```
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {HashRouter, Route, Link} from 'react-router-dom'

//components
import Students from './students'
class App extends Component {
   render() {
      return(
         <div><h1>Home !!</h1>
         <h2>Welcome to React Application !! </h2>
         </div>
      )
   }
}

function getTime() {
   var d = new Date();
   return d.getHours()+":"+d.getMinutes()+":"+d.getSeconds()
}

const routes = <HashRouter>
   <div>
      <h4>Time from react app:{getTime()}</h4>
      <header>
         <h1>  <Link to="/">Home</Link> 
         <Link to = "/students">Students</Link>  </h1>
      </header>
      <Route exact path = "/students" component = {Students}></Route>
      <Route exact path = "/" component = {App}></Route>
   </div>
</HashRouter>

ReactDOM.render(routes, document.querySelector("#root"))
```

### Step 5 − Edit Component Students in Students.js

In Students Component, we will use the following two approaches to load
data −

-   **Fetch API (loadStudents\_noCache)** − This will trigger a new
    request everytime the clicks the student tab.

-   **Apollo Client (loadWithApolloclient)** − This will fetch data from
    the cache.

Add a function **loadWithApolloclient** which queries for students and
time from server. This function will enable caching. Here we use a gql
function to parse the query.

```
async loadWithApolloclient() {
   const query = gql`{
      getTime
      students {
         id
         firstName
      }
   }`;

   const {data} = await  client.query({query})
   return data;
}
```

The **Fetch API** is a simple interface for fetching resources. Fetch
makes it easier to make web requests and handle responses than with the
older XMLHttpRequest. Following method shows loading data directly using
fetch api −

```
async  loadStudents_noCache() {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:9000/graphql', {
      method:'POST',
      headers:{'content-type':'application/json'},
      body:JSON.stringify({query:`{
         getTime
         students {
            id
            firstName
         }
      }`})
   })

   const rsponseBody = await response.json();
   return rsponseBody.data;
}
```

In the constructor of StudentsComponent, call the
**loadWithApolloClient** method. The complete **Student.js** file is
below −

```
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import { Link} from 'react-router-dom'

//Apollo Client
import {ApolloClient, HttpLink, InMemoryCache} from 'apollo-boost'
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
const client = new ApolloClient({
   link: new HttpLink({uri:`http://localhost:9000/graphql`}),
   cache:new InMemoryCache()
})

class Students extends Component {
   constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
         students:[{id:1,firstName:'test'}],
         serverTime:''
      }
      this.loadWithApolloclient().then(data => {
         this.setState({
            students:data.students,
            serverTime:data.getTime
         })
      })
   }
   
   async  loadStudents_noCache() {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:9000/graphql', {
         method:'POST',
         headers:{'content-type':'application/json'},
         body:JSON.stringify({query:`{
            getTime
            students {
               id
               firstName
            }
         }`})
      })
      const rsponseBody =  await response.json();
      return rsponseBody.data;
   }
   
   async loadWithApolloclient() {
      console.log("inside apollo client function")
      const query = gql`{
         getTime
         students {
            id
            firstName
         }
      }`;
      const {data} = await  client.query({query})
      return data;
   }
   
   render() {
      return(
         <div>
            <h3>Time from GraphQL server :{this.state.serverTime}</h3>
            <p>Following Students Found </p>
            <div>
               <ul>
                  {
                     this.state.students.map(s => {
                        return(
                           <li key = {s.id}>
                              {s.firstName}
                           </li>
                        )
                     })
                  }
               </ul>
            </div>
         </div>
      )
   }
}
export default Students
```

### Step 6 − Run the React Application with *npm start*

You can test the react application by switching from home tab to
students tab. Once the students tab is loaded with data from server. It
will cache the data. You can test it by switching from home to students
tab multiple times. The output will be as shown below −

![](./images/output_react_application_with_npm_start.jpg)

If you have loaded the students page first by typing the
URL, **http://localhost:3000/\#/students**, you can see that the load
time for react app and GraphQL would be approximately same. After that
if you switch to home view and return to the GraphQL server, the time
will not change. This shows the data is cached.

### Step 7 − Change loadWithApolloclient Call to loadStudents\_noCache

If you change the load method to **loadStudents\_noCache** in the
constructor of StudentComponent, the output will not cache the data.
This shows the difference between caching and non-caching.

```
this.loadStudents_noCache().then(data => {
   this.setState({
      students:data.students,
      serverTime:data.getTime
   })
})
```

![](./images/output_react_application_with_loadwithapolloclient.jpg)

From the above output, it is clear that if you switch back and forth
between the tabs, the time from graphql server will always be the latest
which means the data is not cached.
